The block diagram of the system can be shown as follow

Every IP should be exported individually.
More detailed information could be found in the design document and workbook on the home page.

## 。Built whole project
Go to this folder `cd project/`.  
This folder can built whole project by the command `bash run_composable_main.sh` under this folder.  
This command will generate `composable_communcation/` vivado project, include communcation composable pipeline block design.  
The commun.bit and commun.hwh files can satisfy both without ecc and with ecc cases.  
The corresponding host code of two cases are include in composable_pipeline.ipynb.  
Cell [1], Cell[2] and Cell[3] are for without ecc case, and the order is [1]->[2]->[3].  
Cell [4], Cell[5] and Cell[6] are for with ecc case, and the order is [4]->[5]->[6].  
Cell [7] is the comparison of the two cases under TAP_NUM=3 and SNR = [0, 5, 10, 15, 20].  

## 。Folder Structure
In this section, the function of all folders in this project would be explained.
#### - jupyer_notebook_project
In this folder, all host code could be found, include:
###### - commun_path.json
###### - composable_pipeline.ipynb
After you use the command `bash run_composable_main.sh` to build porject, two files will be added to the file:
###### - commun.bit
###### - commun.hwh
When you want to use FPGA verification, put the files in this file into jupyer notebook.  

#### - vitis_hls_composable_project
In this folder, all vitis hls source code could be found.  
All source code can be used by `OFDM_HLS_Implementation/src_composable/project/run_composable_vitis.sh` tcl file to generate each vitis project.  
This tcl file is called by `run_composable_main.sh` in `project/` folder. 



- Be aware of the consistency of the vivado version and board. 
The version of vivado we are using is "2021.1",and use board "kv260".
